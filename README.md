The following code can be used to create an automated test for the microservice:

```Python
import requests

# Define endpoints
short_endpoint = "https://ionaapp.com/assignment-magic/dk/short"
long_endpoint = "https://ionaapp.com/assignment-magic/dk/long"

# Define arg values
short_args = ["ab", "12", "a2"]
long_args = ["ab2", "123", "a36"]

def test_short_endpoint():
    """ 
    Tests the `/short/` endpoint with various arg values
    """
    for arg in short_args:
        response = requests.get(f"{short_endpoint}/{arg}")
        assert response.status_code == 200
        data = response.json()
        assert data["uid"] is not None
        assert len(data["uid"]) == 32

def test_long_endpoint():
    """
    Tests the `/long/` endpoint with various arg values
    """
    for arg in long_args:
        response = requests.get(f"{long_endpoint}/{arg}")
        assert response.status_code == 200
        data = response.json()
        assert data["uid"] is not None
        assert len(data["uid"]) == 32

# Run tests
test_short_endpoint()
test_long_endpoint()
```

To wrap the test application into a Docker container, the following Dockerfile can be used:

```
FROM python:3.7-slim 

# Install test dependencies
RUN pip install requests

# Copy the test application
COPY test_application.py /

# Run the test application
ENTRYPOINT ["python", "/test_application.py"]
```


To build and run the container, we can use the following commands:

```bash
docker build -t test_microservice .
docker run --rm test_microservice
```


Question 1:

How are the three backend components currently deployed? Are they running on separate servers or are they co-located on the same server?
Can the 10MB images be compressed or resized without affecting the quality of the image recognition?
How often does the Trainer need to be run to keep the model updated? Is it possible to run the Trainer less frequently to reduce resource usage?
What happens if the Classifier receives an image before the corresponding json file has been generated by the Preclassifier?

Question 2:
To assemble the components in the cloud, we would likely use a combination of services that can provide high scalability and low latency, such as:

Amazon S3 to store the image files, which can then be accessed by the Preclassifier and Classifier components.
Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) instances to run the Preclassifier, Classifier, and Trainer components.
Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS) or Kubernetes to manage containerized versions of the components for better scalability and manageability.
Amazon Elastic File System (EFS) or a similar network file system to allow the components to access the same shared file system for the model file and other necessary files.
A load balancer such as Amazon Elastic Load Balancer (ELB) to distribute incoming requests across multiple instances of the Preclassifier and Classifier components to handle the expected load.

Bonus:
To set up the system in a private cloud, we would need to set up a similar infrastructure as mentioned above but within the private cloud environment. We could use private networking to allow the mobile app to send images over the local network to the backend. We may also need to consider security aspects, such as encrypting the images in transit and at rest, and restricting access to the components and data to authorized users.

Bonus:
To design the system to handle usage peaks beyond the capacity of the current setup, we can consider implementing the following strategies:

Horizontal scaling: Increase the number of instances running the Preclassifier and Classifier components to handle the increased load. This can be done automatically using auto-scaling groups.
Load shedding: Reject requests beyond a certain threshold to avoid overwhelming the system. We can use a queueing system like Amazon Simple Queue Service (SQS) to queue incoming requests and handle them as the system can handle them, with a limit on the number of queued requests.
Caching: Cache the model file and other frequently used data in memory or using a distributed cache like Amazon ElastiCache to reduce the load on the backend components.
CDN: Use a content delivery network (CDN) to serve static content like images and reduce the load on the backend.
