The following code can be used to create an automated test for the microservice:

```Python
import requests

# Define endpoints
short_endpoint = "https://ionaapp.com/assignment-magic/dk/short"
long_endpoint = "https://ionaapp.com/assignment-magic/dk/long"

# Define arg values
short_args = ["ab", "12", "a2"]
long_args = ["ab2", "123", "a36"]

def test_short_endpoint():
    """ 
    Tests the `/short/` endpoint with various arg values
    """
    for arg in short_args:
        response = requests.get(f"{short_endpoint}/{arg}")
        assert response.status_code == 200
        data = response.json()
        assert data["uid"] is not None
        assert len(data["uid"]) == 32

def test_long_endpoint():
    """
    Tests the `/long/` endpoint with various arg values
    """
    for arg in long_args:
        response = requests.get(f"{long_endpoint}/{arg}")
        assert response.status_code == 200
        data = response.json()
        assert data["uid"] is not None
        assert len(data["uid"]) == 32

# Run tests
test_short_endpoint()
test_long_endpoint()
```

To wrap the test application into a Docker container, the following Dockerfile can be used:

```
FROM python:3.7-slim 

# Install test dependencies
RUN pip install requests

# Copy the test application
COPY test_application.py /

# Run the test application
ENTRYPOINT ["python", "/test_application.py"]
```

Question 1:


To plan the migration of the components, we would like to ask the computer vision team a few additional questions, such as: 



What kind of image formats does the Preclassifier and Classifier accept? 

Are the components able to process multiple images in parallel, or is there a maximum number of images they can process at once? 

Are there any other resource requirements aside from CPU and memory that we should be aware of? 

Is the snake.model file updated regularly, and if so, what is the update frequency and how large is the file? 


Question 2:


To assemble the components in the cloud, we would use a combination of container technologies and cloud services. Containers would allow us to package each component separately and easily manage their deployment and scaling. We could use either Docker or Kubernetes as the container orchestration tool, depending on the needs of the project. We would then use a cloud provider such as Amazon Web Services (AWS) or Google Cloud Platform (GCP) to host and manage the components, ensuring a reliable and secure service. We would also need to consider methods for load balancing and auto-scaling, in order to ensure that the application can handle the expected traffic.


Bonus:


For the private cloud setup, we would use similar technologies and cloud services, such as container technologies and cloud provider. However, due to the local network setup, we would need to ensure that all components are configured for communication and data transfer over the local network, and that any authentication, authorization, and security measures are also in place. For usage peaks beyond 10 000 requests per second, we would need to consider technologies such as caching and message queuing to buffer the requests and process them efficiently. We would also need to design the system to be fault tolerant and reliable, so that requests do not get dropped during peak times.
